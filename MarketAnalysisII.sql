Write an SQL query to find for each user whether the brand of the second item (by date) they sold is their favorite brand. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as no. It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on a day.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
The answer for the user with id 1 is no because they sold nothing.
The answer for the users with id 2 and 3 is yes because the brands of their second sold items are their favorite brands.
The answer for the user with id 4 is no because the brand of their second sold item is not their favorite brand.
